# Image Noise Reduction

Implementing some filters from scratch to reduce the salt-and-pepper noise in noisy images. 

## Overview

Salt-and-pepper noise is a form of noise sometimes seen on images. It is also known as impulse noise. This noise can be caused by sharp and sudden disturbances in the image signal. It presents itself as sparsely occurring white and black pixels.

In this project, I have implemented three filters that perform effectively on images with salt-and-pepper noise. The implemented filters are:
* Median Filter
* Mean Filter
* Max Filter

## Usage

Any of the files with extension .m is related to a specific filter. Just run any of them with Matlab.
